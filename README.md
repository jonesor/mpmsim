`mpmsim` is a tool for generating random or semi-random matrix
population models given a particular archetype, based on life history.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `mpmsim` like this:

``` r
# install package 'remotes' if necessary
# will already be installed if 'devtools' is installed
install.packages("remotes")

# argument 'build_opts = NULL' only needed if you want to build vignettes
remotes::install_github("jonesor/mpmsim", build_opts = NULL)
```

## Usage

First remember to load the package.

``` r
library(mpmsim)
```

Generate some MPMs.

``` r
randomMPM(nStage = 4, Fec = 20, archetype = 1)
