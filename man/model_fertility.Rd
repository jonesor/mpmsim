\title{Model fertility with age using set functional forms}
\usage{
model_fertility(age = NULL, params, maturity = 0, model = "logistic")
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{A numeric vector representing age.}

\item{params}{A numeric vector of parameters for the selected model. The
number and meaning of parameters depend on the selected model.}

\item{maturity}{A non-negative numeric value indicating the age at maturity.
Whatever model is used, the fertility is forced to be 0 below the age of
maturity.}

\item{model}{A character string specifying the model to use. Must be one of
"logistic", "step", "vonbertalanffy","normal" or "hadwiger".}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing the computed fertility values.
}
\description{
This function computes fertility based on the logistic, step, von
Bertalanffy, Hadwiger, and normal models.
The logistic model assumes that fertility increases sigmoidally with age from
maturity until a maximum fertility is reached.
The step model assumes that fertility is zero before the age of maturity and
then remains constant.
The von Bertalanffy model assumes that, after maturity, fertility increases
asymptotically with age until a maximum fertility is reached. In this
formulation, the model is set up so that fertility is 0 at the 'age of
maturity - 1', and increases from that point.
The Hadwiger model is rather complex and is intended to model human fertility
with a characteristic hump-shaped fertility.
For all models, the output ensures that fertility is zero before the age at
maturity.

\details{
The required parameters varies depending on the fertility model. The
parameters are provided as a vector and the parameters must be provided in
the order mentioned here.
\itemize{
\item Logistic: \eqn{f(x) = A / (1 + exp(-k  (x - x_m)))}
\item Step: \eqn{f(x)=
  \begin{cases}
  A, x \geq m \\
  A, x <  m
  \end{cases}}
\item von Bertalanffy: \eqn{f(x) = A  (1 - exp(-k  (x - x_0)))}
\item Normal: \eqn{f(x) = A \times \exp\left(
  -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{\!2}\,\right)}
\item Hadwiger: \eqn{f(x) = \frac{ab}{c} \left (\frac{c}{x}  \right )
   ^\frac{3}{2} \exp \left \{ -b^2  \left ( \frac{c}{x}+\frac{x}{c}-2
   \right ) \right \}}
