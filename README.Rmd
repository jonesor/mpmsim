<!-- badges: end -->

`mpmsim` contains tools for generating random or semi-random matrix population models (MPMs) given a particular life history archetype. It also facilitates the generation of Leslie matrices, and the simulation of MPMs based on expected transition rates and sample sizes. This can be useful for exploring uncertainty in inferences when sample sizes are small (or unknown). 

## Installation

You can install the latest GitHub version of `mpmsim` like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install package 'remotes' if necessary
# will already be installed if 'devtools' is installed
install.packages("remotes")

# argument 'build_opts = NULL' only needed if you want to build vignettes
remotes::install_github("jonesor/mpmsim", build_opts = NULL)
```

To install from the development branch, which may have additional functionality, use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("jonesor/mpmsim", ref = "dev")
```

Note, however, that this version is likely to be buggy.

## Usage

First, load the package.

```{r}
library(mpmsim)
```

### Generate a Leslie matrix

The `make_leslie_mpm` function can be used to generate a Leslie matrix, where the stages represent discrete age classes. In a Leslie matrix, survival is represented in the lower sub-diagonal and the lower-right-hand corner element, while fertility is shown in the top row. Both survival and fertility have a length equal to the number of stages in the model. Users can specify both survival and fertility as either a single value or a vector of values, with a length equal to the dimensions of the matrix model. If these arguments are single values, the value is repeated along the survival/fertility sequence.

```{r}
make_leslie_mpm(
  survival = seq(0.1, 0.45, length.out = 4),
  fertility = c(0, 0, 2.4, 5), n_stages = 4, split = FALSE
)
```

### Using a functional form for mortality

Users can generate Leslie matrices with particular functional forms of mortality by first making a data frame of a simplified life table that includes age and survival probability within each age interval.

```{r}
(surv_prob <- model_survival(params = c(0.2, 0.4), model = "Gompertz"))
```

Age-specific survival probability is given by the `px` column in the output from `model_survival`. Users can also use a functional form for fertility (see `model_fertility`) and here a simple step function is assumed.

```{r}
survival <- surv_prob$px
fertility <- model_fertility(
  age = 0:(length(survival) - 1),
  params = c(A = 5), maturity = 2, model = "step"
)
```

Subsequently, these survival and fertility values can be applied to the Leslie matrix as follows.

```{r}
make_leslie_mpm(
  survival = survival, fertility = fertility,
  n_stages = length(survival), split = FALSE
)
```


### Sets of Leslie matrices

Users can generate large numbers of plausible Leslie matrices by repeating the `make_leslie_mpm` command in a loop. For example, the following code produces a list of five Leslie matrices that have increasing survival with age.

```{r}
sample_size <- 5
juvSurv <- runif(n = sample_size, min = 0.0, max = 0.1)
adultSurv <- runif(n = sample_size, min = 0.4, max = 0.8)
adultFert <- rpois(sample_size, 6)

outputMPMs <- NULL
for (i in 1:sample_size) {
  outputMPMs[[i]] <- make_leslie_mpm(
    survival = seq(juvSurv[i], adultSurv[i], length.out = 6),
    fertility = c(0, 0, rep(adultFert[i], 4)), n_stages = 6, split = FALSE
  )
}

outputMPMs
```

Here's one way to do a similar thing with uncertainty applied to a Gompertz mortality.

```{r}
sample_size <- 5
b0_values <- rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = 0.3, sd = 0.1)
b1_values <- rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = 0.4, sd = 0.1)
fertility_values <- rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = 3, sd = 1)

outputMPMs <- NULL
for (i in 1:sample_size) {
  surv_prob <- model_survival(
    params = c(b0_values[i], b1_values[i]),
    model = "Gompertz"
  )
  survival <- surv_prob$px

  maturity <- 2
  fertility <- c(
    rep(0, maturity),
    rep(fertility_values[i], length(survival) - maturity)
  )

  outputMPMs[[i]] <- make_leslie_mpm(
    survival = survival, fertility = fertility,
    n_stages = length(survival), split = FALSE
  )
}

outputMPMs
```


### Simulate sampling error for an MPM

The function `add_mpm_error` can be used to simulate an MPM with sampling error, based on expected transition rates (survival and fecundity) and sample sizes. The expected transition rates must be provided as matrices. The sample size(s) can be given as either a matrix of sample sizes for each element of the matrix or as a single value which is then applied to all elements of the matrix. 

The function uses a binomial process to simulate survival/growth elements and a Poisson process to simulate the fecundity elements. As a result, when sample sizes are large, the simulated MPM will closely reflect the expected transition rates. In contrast, when sample sizes are small, the simulated matrices will become more variable. 

To illustrate use of the function, the following code first generates a 3-stage Leslie matrix using the `make_leslie_mpm` function. It then passes the U and F matrices from this Leslie matrix to the `add_mpm_error` function. Then, two matrices are simulated, first with a sample size of 1000, and then with a sample size of seven.

```{r}
mats <- make_leslie_mpm(
  survival = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.8),
  fertility = c(0, 2.2, 4.4),
  n_stages = 3, split = TRUE
)

add_mpm_error(
  mat_U = mats$mat_U, mat_F = mats$mat_F,
  sample_size = 1000, split = FALSE, by_type = FALSE
)

add_mpm_error(
  mat_U = mats$mat_U, mat_F = mats$mat_F,
  sample_size = 7, split = FALSE, by_type = FALSE
)
```

A list of an arbitrary number of matrices can be generated easily using `replicate`, as follows. 


```{r}
replicate(
  n = 5,
  add_mpm_error(
    mat_U = mats$mat_U, mat_F = mats$mat_F,
    sample_size = 7, split = FALSE, by_type = FALSE
  )
)
```

### Generate single random Lefkovitch MPMs

The `random_mpm` function can be used to generate a random Lefkovitch matrix population model (MPM) with element values based on defined life history archetypes. The function draws survival and transition/growth probabilities from a Dirichlet distribution to ensure that the column totals, including death, are less than or equal to 1. Fecundity can be specified as a single value or as a vector with a length equal to the dimensions of the matrix. If specified as a single value, it is placed in the top-right corner of the matrix. If specified as a vector of length `n_stages`, it spans the entire top row of the matrix. The `archetype` argument can be used to constrain the MPMs, for example, `archetype = 2` constraints the survival probability to increase monotonically as individuals advance to later stages. For more information, see the documentation for `random_mpm` and Takada et al. (2018). In the following example, I split the output matrices into the `U` and `F` matrices, which could be summed to create the `A` matrix.

```{r}
(rMPM <- random_mpm(
  n_stages = 3, fecundity = 20,
  archetype = 2, split = TRUE
))
```

### Generate a set of random Lefkovitch MPMs

The `generate_mpm_set` function can be used to quickly generate large numbers of Lefkovitch MPMs using the above approach. For example, the following code generates five MPMs with archetype 1. By using the `constraint` argument, users can specify an acceptable characteristics for the set of matrices. In this case, population growth rate range, which can be useful for life history analyses where we might assume that only life histories with lambda values close to 1 can persist in nature.


```{r}
library(popbio)
constrain_df <- data.frame(fun = "lambda", arg = NA, lower = 0.9, upper = 1.1)
generate_mpm_set(
  n = 5, n_stages = 4, fecundity = 8, archetype = 1, constraint = constrain_df
)
```

### Plot a matrix

It can be helpful to visualise the matrices. This can be accomplished with the function `plot_matrix`. The output of `plot_matrix` is of class `ggplot` and as such the colour scheme can be modified in the usual way with, for example, `scale_fill_gradient` or similar. 

Here's the matrix:

```{r}
rMPM$mat_U
```

And here's the plot:

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
p <- plot_matrix(rMPM$mat_U)
p + ggplot2::scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "yellow")
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave("man/figures/plot_a_matrix01.png", width = 300, height = 300, units = "px")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/plot_a_matrix01.png")
```
